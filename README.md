# MarkAndRecapture
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DevangLiya/MarkAndRecapture/master)

Simulation for mark and recapture method used in ecology to estimate population size.

**What can we currently do?**
-----
* Choose sampling size.
* Add small variations in sampling size to simulate real sampling.
* Choose the number of samplings.
	
**To-do:**
-----
- [ ] Find a way to use ndarray to enhance the speed.
- [ ] Improve population def and marking.
- [ ] Add tools to visualize the effect of variation of different parameters.
- [x] Develop an easy to use GUI or a web-based UI.
